[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sakhnik/gpwsafe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sakhnik/github)

This is a reimplementation of the unix command line utility
[pwsafe](http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe/), which hasn't been updated
since 2005.

It should be compatible with the recent versions of the original
[Password Safe](http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/).

The goal is to keep the source code short, simple and correct.
Run the unit test suite with `make test`.

If you find a bug or want to improve the code, please open a pull request.

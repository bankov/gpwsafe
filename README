This is a reimplementation of the unix command line utility
pwsafe (http://nsd.dyndns.org/pwsafe/), which hasn't been updated
since 2005.

It should be compatible with the recent versions of the original
Password Safe (http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/).

The goal is to keep the source code short, simple and correct.
Run the unit test suite with `make check'.
